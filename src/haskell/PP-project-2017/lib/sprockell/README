As copied from the Blackboard page for this project:

Here are the Haskell files with the code for the final project:

- BasicFunctions.hs: some elementary functions used in teh various files below

- HardwareTypes.hs: the type definitions, including the instruction set

- Sprockell.hs: the code for the Sprockell processor

- System.hs: the code for the shared memory system, including the communication with the sprockells

- Simulation.hs: some functions to simulate a sprockell and the full system

- DemoMultipleSprockells.hs: contains example with 4 Sprockells

- ParseBasis: with types and additional functions for the Haskell parser generator

- ParserGen: the Haskell parser generator

- slides.pdf: slides with a sketch of the architecture
